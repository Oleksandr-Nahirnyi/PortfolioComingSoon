        /*TODO 1
        Info:
        Now let's properly position the elements on our page, starting with logo.
        Sometimes you want to style an element inside another, like in our case you want to style <h1>
        that is inside the logo container (div), because if later you add more h1's to you page you dont want them to have
        the same style as logo, coz it'll break the page.
        Task:
        1. To access the h1 inside the logo div, just write the wrapping element first followed the element insideof it, like so:
        .element element {
        }
        2. Then let's move it further from the page sides. For that add property called padding and set it to 25px (25 pixels)
        */
        /*TODO 2
        Info:
        Now let's position or main-text element in the middle of the page not only by width, but by height as well.
        For that better not to use pixels, because the height of the device that user will view your website can be different.
        We have "vh" for it, vh is window height, no matter what device you open you website on 100vh is the height.
        Task:
        1. Remove the Really soon paragraph, we don't need it anymore
        2. In styles part of the code find where you already addressed main-text element
        3. Add the second property called "margin-top", "margin" like "padding" it's another way to offset the elements
        - Please read this short article to understand the difference https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-margin-vs-padding
        4. Let's set it to 35vh, which will place the main-text element approximatly in the middle (it's not the best way to position
        in the middle, but for now it'll do, later we will lear the better way)
        */
        /*TODO 3
        Info:
        Nobody actually write CSS code inside the HTML in real life, because the bigger website the more code there is, at some
        point it just becomes impossible to scroll and read it. Let's separte our styles and html mark-up.
        Task:
        1. In this folder create a file and name it styles.css
        2. Copy all the CSS code from between the style tags to that file
        3. Delete the style tag with all the CSS inside from index.html
        4. At the top in the <head> tag above the fonts add "link" tag that will show this index.html file where the styles.css file is
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
