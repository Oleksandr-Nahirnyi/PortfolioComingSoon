    Info:
    All webpages consist of header, sections, and footer. HTML has tags specifically for making up these sections:
    <header> Usually stores site logo, menu or contact information </header>
    <section> Is like a paragraph in a book, one topic per section </section>
    <footer> Is in the bottom of the page and has pretty much the same info as header in case user scroll down the page </footer>

    Task:
    - Create header, main section and footer for your website 
    - We will use your name as a logo for your wesite, in you header just put the plain text "Alex Nahirnyi"
    - In main section put the paragrph p that we made before, and below add another p tag with text "Really soon..."
    - Don't put anything in the footer for now

    -->

    <!--TODO 2
    Info:
    We won't learn html here, the reason is simple, you already know enough of it! Whenever you need to add something 
    on your website, you use a particular tag like you used html, head, body, header, section, footer, and p before.
    Just use this or any other cheatsheet from the internet https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

    Task:
    - Let's make you logo bigger and more meaningful, put it into <h1></h1> tag to make it appear as heading
    
    -->


    <!--TODO 3
    Info:
    In order for us to give a style to elements on your page we use CSS. For example, let's put your <p> on the middle of the screen.
    For this we will need to use the html <style> tag. This tag indicates that we will be writing CSS code there.
    
    Here is the ultimate format for CSS code:
    element {
        property-name: property;
    }

    Task:
    - In your head tag open and close <style> tag
    - Since we want to access p tag on our page just write p instead of element in the format example above, open and close squiggly brackets
    - In the brackets write property name text-align and property center

    PS CSS is pretty much the same as HTML, you lready know it us this link or any other to look up rpoperties you need to style the elements

    <!--TODO 4
    Info:
    There is one tag that we will use probably more the any other, it's <div></div> tag. It's a wrapper tag. Other tags can
    take up some space on the page, div just wraps them. Notice that when you set the p tag to be displayed in the middle, both of the 
    paragraphs shifted there, but what if you what to style only one of them? That's where you use the div tag.

    HTML tags also have attributes, the most common is "class" attribute:
    <div class="you-name-it"></div>

    Classes are just the names of particular elements, like people give names to their pets etc.

    Task:
    - Let's wrap our first p tag with div tag
    - Give it class with the name main-text
    - In your styles to address this exact element you write:
    .main-text {

    }
    - And let's make this text bigger by adding font-size property and setting it to 25px
