/*Todo 6 Lets add the background to our header part of the website
 1. Got to pexels.com and download pisture that you think would look good on the background of you website, select the medium size and move it to the img folder in your project
 2. Set background-image to url(img/your-image.jpg)
 3. Set heaight to 100vh so this section will alwasy be the window height
 4. Set background-size to 'cover', this will stretch the image to the viewport
 5. Set background-repeat to 'no-repeat', this will not let the browser to repeat the picture
 6. Set background-attachment to 'fixed', this will fix it at the same spot
